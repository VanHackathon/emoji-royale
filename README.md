# About the game

You are King Emoji!
You`re kingdom is under attack by hordes of dragons.

Gather your citizens resources on a match 3 puzzle, recruit your soldiers on the MOBA screen and prepare your defenses against an evil army

# About the project

This game was built for the Vanhackathon 2017. Our team is formed by 3 developers and 1 designer.

The first task after picking the challenge was to set the background story, to ensure that the game mechanics would make sense on the players mindset.
We looked for universal themes, first considering using a blockchain theme, with different coins as match symbols, but we thought that although it`s a common knowledge theme, the average player wouldn`t identify every concept used on the symbols.
Other options included alien themes, monster themes but they were too basic.

During the creative process we identified the emoji theme would connect to a larger amount of players.

So, we developed our background on this idea, of an emoji king that finds his castle constantly attacked by a dragon and its minions. 
The king needs to assemble emojis to gather power on a match 3 system, this power lets him recruit soldiers on the MOBA screen to fight the enemy minions and kill the dragon.

One of the greatest challenges on the gameplay is to keep a dual mindset. The player has to solve puzzles on the match 3 screen and at the same time check the MOBA screen for the enemy advance on his castle, and manage the resources needed to recruit his defenses.

After the concept decision, we moved to the development.
